# GamifiedToDo

TODOs:

1. adjust Model layer, Dailies has checklist too
2. ToDoView,   only when checklist is not nil, display fraction, otherwise leave it alone
3. details page needs to have a local copy to handle cancel
4. think about dailies repeat from model design 
5. dailies should allow user to see a calendar view,   not just today's list
6. avatar detal page,  tells what level user is at

3. logic to mark a todo item complete,  if checklist is not complete, but mark it as complete, is it allowed, award?
4. in Daily view,  add a few calendar day circles?   add next few days or add entire calendar
