# GamifiedToDo

TODOs:

sort task

1. tododetails screen, check list 
3. details page needs to have a local copy to handle cancel  -- think i am done

2. delete one who todo item 

6. avatar detail page,  tells what level user is at  -- out of scope,  coin number is enough

3. logic to mark a todo item complete,  if checklist is not complete, but mark it as complete, is it allowed, award?
  -- allowed,  award is propotional


5. change delete to swipe -- done
8. when assign a due date,  what time should be assigned?  -- end of day
================



3.empty tags/ search does not work 
4. recalculate coins -- minus, look for due_date < toady's date'


7. what to do when you delete a todo/daily? -- does not change  coin?



never used @oveservedObject/@stateobject,  is it reason why view is not changed?
