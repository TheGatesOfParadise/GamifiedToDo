# GamifiedToDo

TODOs:

sort task

1. tododetails screen, check list 
3. details page needs to have a local copy to handle cancel  -- think i am done

2. delete one who todo item 

1. adjust Model layer, Dailies has checklist too   --  dailies does not hae checklist
4. think about dailies repeat from model design -- out of scope
5. dailies should allow user to see a calendar view,   not just today's list  -- out of scope
6. avatar detail page,  tells what level user is at  -- out of scope,  coin number is enough

8. dailies view should show today's date,  adjust User to have (Date, [Dailies]) -- still thinking

3. logic to mark a todo item complete,  if checklist is not complete, but mark it as complete, is it allowed, award?
  -- allowed,  award is propotional

4. in Daily view,  add a few calendar day circles?   add next few days or add entire calendar  -- too much work


================



4. recalculate coins -- minus, look for due_date < toady's date'
5. change delete to swipe
3. save button disable when data is not complete
2. reset status and coins every 24 hours, does daily needs to have date property? throw out expired todo list
1. throughly check if user is saved in every situation -- delete/add/edit/complete
6. clean up warnings
7. what to do when you delete a todo/daily?   coin change?
