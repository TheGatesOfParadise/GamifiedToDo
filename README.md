# GamifiedToDo

TODOs:

sort task

1. tododetails screen, check list 
3. details page needs to have a local copy to handle cancel  -- think i am done

2. delete one who todo item 

1. adjust Model layer, Dailies has checklist too   --  dailies does not hae checklist
4. think about dailies repeat from model design -- out of scope
5. dailies should allow user to see a calendar view,   not just today's list  -- out of scope
6. avatar detail page,  tells what level user is at  -- out of scope,  coin number is enough

8. dailies view should show today's date,  adjust User to have (Date, [Dailies]) -- still thinking

3. logic to mark a todo item complete,  if checklist is not complete, but mark it as complete, is it allowed, award?
  -- allowed,  award is propotional

4. in Daily view,  add a few calendar day circles?   add next few days or add entire calendar  -- too much work
5. change delete to swipe -- done

================

1. throughly check if user is saved in every situation -- delete/add/edit/complete
3. save button disable when data is not complete
6. clean up warnings

4. recalculate coins -- minus, look for due_date < toady's date'
2. reset status and coins every 24 hours, does daily needs to have date property? throw out expired todo list
7. what to do when you delete a todo/daily?   coin changee
8. when assign a due date,  what time should be assigned?
